# Territorial Landslide Early Warning System
This project was done as a part of SPARK internship at IIT Roorkee.
• Developed a precise landslide susceptibility map using machine learning models, achieving a 93% prediction rate with
Random Forest and Extra Trees algorithms.
• Established hydro-meteorological thresholds for early warnings using Soil Water Index and Radial Basis Function
Networks, attaining 68% accuracy in event delineation.
• Enhanced the Territorial Landslide Early Warning System’s predictive accuracy and reliability, improving community safety
and resilience.
